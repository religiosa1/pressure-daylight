# Sun dial

This [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) app is a fancy clock dial and pressure data chart.
The clock displays sunrise and sunset times and various twilight stages. Something akin to the clock used in the Kingdom Come: Deliverance PC game, only dynamic and displaying true data.

Calculations provided by the [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) library written by [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com/)

Its middle section of the clock displays the current atmospheric pressure.

Under the clock there's an SVG chart, displaying pressure dynamics.
